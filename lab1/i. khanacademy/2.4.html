        <p id="mountain-info">Kazakhstan is mostly a flat country, the bulk of the territory is occupied by semi-deserts, steppes and forest-steppes. Large mountains are located in the border areas, in the south and east of the country.<br>
Only the Altai Mountains are located a considerable distance from Almaty; the rest of the mountainous regions can be reached quite quickly by car.
It takes 30 minutes to drive to the closest one - Trans-Ili Alatau. The farthest ones - the mountains of the Central Tien Shan and the Dzhungar Alatau - can be reached in 4-5 hours by highway.</p>
